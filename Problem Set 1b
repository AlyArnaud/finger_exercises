In Part B copy your solution to Part A (as we are going to reuse much of that
machinery).  Modify your program to include the following
1. Have the user input a semi-annual salary raise semi_annual_raise 
(as a decimal percentage)
2. After the 6th month, increase your salary by that percentage.  
Do the same after the 12th month, the 18  month, and so on. 
Write a program to calculate how many months it will take you save up enough 
money for a down payment.  LIke before, assume that your investments earn a 
return of r = 0.04 (or 4%) and the required down payment percentage is 0.25 
(or 25%).  Have the user enter the following variables: 
1. The starting annual salary (annual_salary)
2. The percentage of salary to be saved (portion_saved)
3. The cost of your dream home (total_cost)
4. The semi­annual salary raise (semi_annual_raise)
